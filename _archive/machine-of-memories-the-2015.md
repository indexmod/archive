# {{page.title}} Olga about the video

I asked people on the Internet tell us about their first memories of life. It was interesting to gather stories of people I had never seen and did not know—that they felt, saw, what feelings they are experiencing now remembering these moments? So, I got a clean set of visual images of people's lives. Then, I voiced these memories with the help of computer voices. And with the help of video endlessly spinning turbine created the image of android-memory aggregation of fifty strangers.1
