(Est. 2013, city) is a Raku (Jp. 楽焼 raku-yaki)—is a Japanese pottery that is used in the Japanese Tea Ceremony in the form of tea bowls. It is characterized by hand shaped; fairly porous vessels; glazes. The fired raku piece is removed from the hot kiln and is allowed to cool in the open air. The technique of placing the ware in a container filled with combustible material is not a traditional Raku practice. Sign in to edit Raku <span id="a1">[\[1\]](#f1)</span>. Raku means “enjoyment”, “comfort” or “ease” and is derived from Jurakudai, the name of a palace, in Kyoto, that was built by Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1537–1598), who was the leading warrior statesman of the time. In the 16th century, Sen Rikyū, the Japanese tea master, was involved with the construction of the Jurakudai and had a tile-maker, named Chōjirō, produce hand-moulded tea bowls for use in the wabi-styled tea ceremony that was Rikyū's ideal.1 Login to edit
