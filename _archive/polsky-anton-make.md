# {{page.title}} On way to activism
In the late 90s, fascinated by graffiti, Anton created the first Russian magazine about street art. In recent years he worked as a designer in the online newspaper The Village. In 2010, he wrote a manifesto “Moscow 2020” on specific reforms in the capital. Then he participated in the organization of the festival community “Delay Sam”.2 Finally Moscow has acquired a printing cycling map Use / Less.3 In 2011, together with his wife Sonja and friend Igor Anton Ponosov created a website partizaning.org, dedicated underground rescheduling of the urban environment. According to the Polish, “Partizaning”—a new movement, which lies at the intersection of art and social space.4
