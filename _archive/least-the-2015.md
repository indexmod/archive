# {{page.title}} The video
Artist, her mother and sister moving in a lifeless monotone 3D-landscape. At the core of the work is the idea of the impossibility of the women to show their maternal feelings for the man. Finding herself a woman becomes a victim of imagery. But neither a mother nor the image of his wife, sister or daughter is not the end, it is always relative.
