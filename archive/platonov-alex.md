# Bio

Studied journalistic at MGU and film direction and documental theater at Marina Razhbezhkina Studio at Moscow Film School. My passion for photography made me quit the TV job, I went to the Moscow academy of photography and learned to work with studio light and started a career of a glossy magazines photographer. After some years I started shooting video and slowly moved away from commercial photo shootings to making documentary video. At that time I started to earn money for living by motion computer graphics with a team of friends, so I don’t have a necessity to seek for video making jobs. I felt an obstacle to develop my vision as a documentary filmmaker and went to the School of Documentary Film & Theatre in Moscow. It was a yearlong mind blowing adventure, which totally changed my approach to camera and editing. I made two films during that period, which are totally different from what I made before and I feel myself on the beginning of a new path. One of them, “Ostrov”, was made together with Agnia, with whom we plan to work together on this film. Also at the end of 2015 I made a web documentary project, combining in a single online narration videos, texts and photos from a personal deep immersion into rural Russia. (Self-bio for documentary festival in Berlin).
