# {{page.title}} — A virtual museum

A three-dimensional virtual museum where you can learn all about the art of living in the global network. World masterpieces have been translated into a new language, their history and destiny rethought in the encoding of the virtual environment, smears of paint transferred to the pixels. The viewer is on the World Wide Web, which can observe the great compression fabrics for screen size and search in Google—pictures. The game updates the museum exhibits under the rules of the virtual world: the so-known work damaged Picasso's "Dream" is divided into pixels, and the stolen paintings are accompanied by blocking windows "404 Not Found». Such associative jokes and finds escorted about 120 paintings, arranged in infinite white space. The movement is carried forward arrow keys, back, left, right. Space used for jumping. Museum visitors pass exposure, consisting of a one-sided canvases with small explanatory plates. When you rotate 180 degrees pictures disappear and appear more text telling the story in more detail selected works. Some of the paintings are accompanied by sound effects. When he reached the last scene—the huge black screen rectangle Rothko, the viewer can complete a game or return to the start, turned to the starting point and use the space bar and arrow forward for promotion on an inclined surface up.
