# History

Since 2010 ASA’s goal has been twofold. On the one hand, the organization strives to inform locals about Street Art in Amsterdam and around the world. On the other hand local artists, the creative industry in Amsterdam and international artists work together to exhibit a diverse range of works in a wide variety of places. The annual Amsterdam Street Art festival has provided a platform for local and international artists on the street of Amsterdam, but also in various associated galleries. Besides generating awareness, the combination of showing works outdoors contributed to the perception and acceptance of Street Art in Amsterdam.

Besides the festival, ASA commissioned many artists murals in recent years, has over 77k follower on Facebook and functions as an advisory board for companies and organizations regarding Street Art <span id="a3">[\[3\]](#f3)</span>.

# Mission

ASA mission is to give street art a massive boost in Amsterdam. We want to achieve this by creating a community/platform, organize events and exhibitions, paint jams and whatever tickles our fancy—a place where international artists and creative people like to work and live, a city where inhabitants value creative expressions by their peers who work in Amsterdam for an international market <span id="a3">[\[3\]](#f3)</span>.
