## About "The Diary of Space Journeys"

With the end of the Cold War and the arms race it seems that we have lost all interest in space. Cosmonauts' going to the space station has become a routine event, science fiction's popularity as a genre has become limited, and the majority of people stopped dreaming about discovering new worlds. Half a century ago it was dramatically different. There was a feeling that conquering new planets would be achieved within a matter of several decades. The official ideology supported that great dream: the conquest of space became a symbolof humanity's victory over the powers of nature.

Veronika Zlobina, Anna Kurbatova and Alia Sadretdinova propose returning the dream of space travel to humanity. For that they turn to the drawings by K. E. Tsiolkovsky from the “Album Of Space Travel”. More than just one generation of cosmonauts, engineers and scientists were inspired by Tsiolkovsky's works to search for the means to bring about space travel. The artists propose installing copies of Tsiolkovsky's drawings, made with neon tubes, in the streets of Moscow whose names remind us of space research: roads named after Korolev, Tsiolkovsky, Tsander, Planet street and Star (Zvezdnyi) boulevard. If looked at from space, they will make up another drawing by Tsiolkovsky—a space rocket flight path.
