# Why some articles of Indexmod Encyclopedia non-English?

The Indexmod Encyclopedia data core are articles in English, but you can create pages in any language and kept layout matches the [Template](https://indexmod.github.io/encyclopedia/template).

# How can I translate page in Indexmod Encyclopedia?

Create copy of the page which you want to be translated. Paste [sample of the page](internet-yami-ichi) translated into simplified Russian. Use 

`Translation mode` 

label on top section of the page as warning for other editors.

# Why some of the articles are published without content (as template)?

From 2017, Indexmod Encyclopedia moves from the [Google hosting](https://sites.google.com/site/indexmodencyclopedia/list-of-pages) to the own one based on Jekyll and Github Pages. Some of the articles have not yet been transferred. And the part has been in the status of "claimed for creation" for several years. You can continue to edit such an article right now.
